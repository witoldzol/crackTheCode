First day of freedom. I've finished my fourth degree, which is a complete overkill, but hey, what can you do? 
So what now? Prep for interview! Already got a fancy book, with hundreds of exercises to do. We'll see how this 
fares. Not sure if I want to do the exercises in Java or stick to JS. Probably latter, given that I really want 
to focus on just one programming language. I'm also changing the morning routine. I'll be waking up at 4am now,
as opposed to 5.30, because I found that I'm just not gettin anything done in the afternoon after work. So yea,
I'll give it a go and see what happens.

I slept in. Had yesterday meeting with a software dev team manager. Looks like his going to try and help me out.
He wasn't very reassuring though, saying that for someone to get into tech would be tough, its easier to move out
of it. Anywawy, he might get me a mock interview which would be great. So now I'm under pressure to prepare for it.
Unfortunately, my company is all about Java, so I'll have to brush up on it, and store away JS for the time being.
Whats the plan for today: study for 2 hours, and then relax I guess.

I'm having problem saving changes made in org file ( this bloody file ! ). No idea what is causing it. Honesty, its
pain enough to keep this blog running after whole day. I really don't feel like tinkering away at some useless stuff
like this. 
Ok I figure it out...this file is OUTSIDE of my git folder...what the actual..
