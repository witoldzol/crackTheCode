First day of freedom. I've finished my fourth degree, which is a complete overkill, but hey, what can you do? 
So what now? Prep for interview! Already got a fancy book, with hundreds of exercises to do. We'll see how this 
fares. Not sure if I want to do the exercises in Java or stick to JS. Probably latter, given that I really want 
to focus on just one programming language. I'm also changing the morning routine. I'll be waking up at 4am now,
as opposed to 5.30, because I found that I'm just not gettin anything done in the afternoon after work. So yea,
I'll give it a go and see what happens.

I slept in. Had yesterday meeting with a software dev team manager. Looks like his going to try and help me out.
He wasn't very reassuring though, saying that for someone to get into tech would be tough, its easier to move out
of it. Anywawy, he might get me a mock interview which would be great. So now I'm under pressure to prepare for it.
Unfortunately, my company is all about Java, so I'll have to brush up on it, and store away JS for the time being.
Whats the plan for today: study for 2 hours, and then relax I guess.

I'm having problem saving changes made in org file ( this bloody file ! ). No idea what is causing it. Honesty, its
pain enough to keep this blog running after whole day. I really don't feel like tinkering away at some useless stuff
like this. 
Ok I figure it out...this file is OUTSIDE of my git folder...what the actual..

I didn't study yesterday after work. Felt very tired and bit dejected. Today I've made some good progress on the 
Big O notations. Its going slow but steady I guess. I've spent last two days at work working on my Sprint app. 
I made it look nicer! I really enjoyed tinkering with it, but enough is enough, I recogize it's a waste of time.

Worket through fibonacci and cached version that uses memoization ( never heard of it before ).
Normal fibonacci is O(2toN) where cached version is O(N) which is pretty amazing!
All we do in cached version is retrieval of previous values and summation ! Since fibonacci is a 
sume of two previous numbers -- and we start with 0 & 1...we don't really do anything other then
saving previous result and adding stored results to each other on next call.
Memoization remembers all the previous results - hence we don't have to do the same calculations
over and over again ( makes sense ! ).
I have to fix my CV today and send it over for review.

I've worked through the rest of examples of Big O notation. Working on further examples now. 
I'm making progress on sqlite tutorial at work. Still not sure how to design the time taking 
algorithm. Originally I was thinking just to start timer, and stop it when button is pressed. 
Whatever time was calculated save to the database. But what if the computer crashes or whatever?
So instead, maybe keep saving progress of time by 30 min increments? This way, if anything 
happens, at least we have some data. 
Once timer starts, save progress every 30 min. We don't take note of brakes so that 
makes life easier.

Very bad day yesterday, mood is down, things to do pile up. Gotta keep marching on, and remember that
not everything ( acutally very few things ) are really important. 
The bad: My illness flared up again, I will
not have luggage for the spanish trip, I'm behind with the CV, my private life is in shambles, I'm 
constantly tired because I wake up at 4am to do this thing.
The good: I don't have a permanent illness, it will pass. At least I can afford to go to Spain in the
first place, and I have friends to go with ! I have someone looking after me, trying to help me get a 
job, and motivating me to make a CV. I have a reason to get up at 4am!! 
Good times.

Sometimes I'm afraid of the coming morning, the fact that I will have to tackle problems
that make my brain hurt. It's uncomfortable, and I'd like to very much avoid it. I've read
this book called 'Too good to be ignored' or something like that, where the author spells it
out: 'True growth lies outside of comfort zone'. But he puts it in different way, talks about
physical pain and discomfort. He gave a really good comparison of himself and some other guy.
They both played guitar when teenarges, but the latter achieved massive success because he 
kept training on the edge of his abilities constantly! The former spent far less time outside 
the comfort zone. 
That's what I can see in myself, I very rarely venture out to the 'unknown'. Both in life, and
in my learning. I'm old enough to know that there's no point in making myself empty promises. 
The only thing that really works ( for me ), are painfully slow incremental improvements.

I've missed few days, things are falling apart. My current illness is not helping.
I havent coded at all, I did follow few tutorials online, and looked more into the 
time tracker application. I decided to go with the JavaFX for the UI, given that
there is plenty of tutorials on it, and it looks very promising. I will stick
with SQLite, given how remarkably small it is, and the fact that it's serverless.
I don't know if I will work on reporting side of the whole project, but I guess
it would make sense. 
I feel like I'm trying to do too many things at once: work on Cracking the Code, 
read through the Design Patterns, build a timetracker app, wake up at 4am, solve 
catas...its too much. I know my strenghts, and multitasking is not one of them.
I will axe Design Patterns and catas for the time being. I'd like to keep doing 
the interview prep every day for 2hrs and dedicate rest of my time to the time 
tracker. I believe that building  an app will give me more practice in coding
than solving random catas online.
