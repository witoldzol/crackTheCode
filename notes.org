First day of freedom. I've finished my fourth degree, which is a complete overkill, but hey, what can you do? 
So what now? Prep for interview! Already got a fancy book, with hundreds of exercises to do. We'll see how this 
fares. Not sure if I want to do the exercises in Java or stick to JS. Probably latter, given that I really want 
to focus on just one programming language. I'm also changing the morning routine. I'll be waking up at 4am now,
as opposed to 5.30, because I found that I'm just not gettin anything done in the afternoon after work. So yea,
I'll give it a go and see what happens. 

** 11-08-2018 Saturday
I slept in. Had yesterday meeting with a software dev team manager. Looks like his going to try and help me out.
He wasn't very reassuring though, saying that for someone to get into tech would be tough, its easier to move out
of it. Anywawy, he might get me a mock interview which would be great. So now I'm under pressure to prepare for it.
Unfortunately, my company is all about Java, so I'll have to brush up on it, and store away JS for the time being.
Whats the plan for today: study for 2 hours, and then relax I guess. 
** 15-08-2018 Wednesday
I'm having problem saving changes made in org file ( this bloody file ! ). No idea what is causing it. Honesty, its
pain enough to keep this blog running after whole day. I really don't feel like tinkering away at some useless stuff
like this. 
Ok I figure it out...this file is OUTSIDE of my git folder...what the actual..

** 17-08-2018 Friday
I didn't study yesterday after work. Felt very tired and bit dejected. Today I've made some good progress on the 
Big O notations. Its going slow but steady I guess. I've spent last two days at work working on my Sprint app. 
I made it look nicer! I really enjoyed tinkering with it, but enough is enough, I recogize it's a waste of time. 
** 20-08-2018
Worket through fibonacci and cached version that uses memoization ( never heard of it before ).
Normal fibonacci is O(2toN) where cached version is O(N) which is pretty amazing!
All we do in cached version is retrieval of previous values and summation ! Since fibonacci is a 
sume of two previous numbers -- and we start with 0 & 1...we don't really do anything other then
saving previous result and adding stored results to each other on next call.
Memoization remembers all the previous results - hence we don't have to do the same calculations
over and over again ( makes sense ! ).
I have to fix my CV today and send it over for review. 
** 21-08-2018
I've worked through the rest of examples of Big O notation. Working on further examples now. 
I'm making progress on sqlite tutorial at work. Still not sure how to design the time taking 
algorithm. Originally I was thinking just to start timer, and stop it when button is pressed. 
Whatever time was calculated save to the database. But what if the computer crashes or whatever?
So instead, maybe keep saving progress of time by 30 min increments? This way, if anything 
happens, at least we have some data. 
Once timer starts, save progress every 30 min. We don't take note of brakes so that 
makes life easier.
** 22-08-2018
Very bad day yesterday, mood is down, things to do pile up. Gotta keep marching on, and remember that
not everything ( acutally very few things ) are really important. 
The bad: My illness flared up again, I will
not have luggage for the spanish trip, I'm behind with the CV, my private life is in shambles, I'm 
constantly tired because I wake up at 4am to do this thing.
The good: I don't have a permanent illness, it will pass. At least I can afford to go to Spain in the
first place, and I have friends to go with ! I have someone looking after me, trying to help me get a 
job, and motivating me to make a CV. I have a reason to get up at 4am!! 
Good times.
** 23-08-2018
Sometimes I'm afraid of the coming morning, the fact that I will have to tackle problems
that make my brain hurt. It's uncomfortable, and I'd like to very much avoid it. I've read
this book called 'Too good to be ignored' or something like that, where the author spells it
out: 'True growth lies outside of comfort zone'. But he puts it in different way, talks about
physical pain and discomfort. He gave a really good comparison of himself and some other guy.
They both played guitar when teenarges, but the latter achieved massive success because he 
kept training on the edge of his abilities constantly! The former spent far less time outside 
the comfort zone. 
That's what I can see in myself, I very rarely venture out to the 'unknown'. Both in life, and
in my learning. I'm old enough to know that there's no point in making myself empty promises. 
The only thing that really works ( for me ), are painfully slow incremental improvements.
** 26-08-2018
I've missed few days, things are falling apart. My current illness is not helping.
I havent coded at all, I did follow few tutorials online, and looked more into the 
time tracker application. I decided to go with the JavaFX for the UI, given that
there is plenty of tutorials on it, and it looks very promising. I will stick
with SQLite, given how remarkably small it is, and the fact that it's serverless.
I don't know if I will work on reporting side of the whole project, but I guess
it would make sense. 
I feel like I'm trying to do too many things at once: work on Cracking the Code, 
read through the Design Patterns, build a timetracker app, wake up at 4am, solve 
catas...its too much. I know my strenghts, and multitasking is not one of them.
I will axe Design Patterns and catas for the time being. I'd like to keep doing 
the interview prep every day for 2hrs and dedicate rest of my time to the time 
tracker. I believe that building  an app will give me more practice in coding
than solving random catas online. 
** 27-08-2018
I realised that I have no idea what hash tables/maps are. Turns out
they are a big deal. Great, what a relief, I can dive into tutorial
rather than break my brain on those crazy algos. There's a whole list 
of data structures that I absolutely have to know. I'll start with 
the one I don't know anything about, and refresh the later on.
** 12-09-2018
It's been a while since my last entry. Not going to bs, things are tough.
I got sick and I used it as an excuse to let my routine collapse. Then came
annual leave, and here we are, half a month later. I'm not going to overthink 
it or beat myself about it. Just gotta pick up where I left and keep on moving.
** 13-09-2018
I'm absolutely terrified of each morning, scared that I won't understand
the questions. Makes no sense right? I mean, the asumption is that I don't 
get things, THAT'S why I'm learning them. Interesting. Anyway, it's going
really slow. I'm trying to wrap my  head around some very basic concepts.
I'm learning about hash tables at the moment, trying to figure out how to
get duplicates out of it etc. 
I've learned yesterday that I might have a shot at the interview for the
internal graduate scheme. That would set me on a fast track to becoming a 
programmer. This is it, I guess. Best chance I'll get in a while. Of course
I'm terrified that I will blow it, as I usually do. It weird that even good 
things scare me. 
** 14-09-2018
I've sent my first CV, going for the Leap program.
Bit stressed out about it, this could be a game changer. 
Still stuck on hash tables, turnes out they don't allow duplicate keys
(they do, in so much they don't throw error -> they simply overwrite old value).
So now I'm exploring the Lists, and further, I think it's unnecesary to use it 
for the problem that I'm looking...oh wait maybe it is ...
** 15-09-2018
Difference between List and Set: the latter follows mathematical notion of set,
meaning, no duplicates allowed. Set also uses hash values to allocate elements,
and that's why it doesn't preserve the insertion order ( unlike List )
I finally finished the very first example from the book. Yay! Theres like 100 more
to go. At this rate I will finish next year...Nay! Haha.
Today I plan to go to work, on the timetracker application, and then go to the 'Coder
dojo' for kids...no idea why tho. All I knew ( when I was asked ) was that I didn't 
want to do it...so I decided to do it, just on that basis. So we are going. That's that.
** 16-09-2018
Sunday - day off. Played new indie game, bit grindy, but still fun. Altough, I'm trying to hard,
I should just finish it without min maxing.

Permutations: order of the selection matters !

Permutations:
If we have 4 candies, and we can only select 2, how many permutations?
First question: how many stages / selections / choices ?
Anser: Two: first and second
First choice: how many options? Answer = 4 
Second choice: how many options?       = 3
Total permutations? 4 * 3 = 12

Formula = n! / (n-r)!  
r-number of ways things can be selected (in above case, 2)

Permutations without restrictions:
4 candies, how many max permutations?
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
------------------------------
Combination: order of selection doesn't matter !
Example: red red blue == red blue red ( same combination of colors, just different order )

Formula = n! / (n-r)!r!

For example: 4 colors, 2 choices =>
4*3*2*1 / (4-2)!*( 2*1 )
24 / 2*2
24 / 4
Answer == 6 combinations

We worked only 1 hour today. I did spend time on excercises.
** 18-09-2018
I 'solved' the permutation example. It turned out to be trivial, once 
you realise something quite obvious. I don't think I'd be able to figure 
it out in the stressful situation such as an interview, but oh well, no
point worrying about it. We keep on marching forward. Time is running out.
** 19-09-2018
Had a horrible day yesterday, but there was plenty to be learned from it:

JavaScript:
turns out, when you try to perform an operation on an element
that doesn't exists, you will get an error that stops execution of the rest 
of the script. 
For example: -->
let element = document.getElementById('abc').innerHTML
Above has two actions: gets the element, and then gets the inner html content
If the first fails, thats fine, but then the second action will result in fatal
error
Solution: -->
let element = document.getElementById('abc')  // get your element
if ( element ) let content = element.innerHTML  // test if element exists, and get content

Yes its more verbose but it works really well, which is fine with me
----------

Another one:
You can use 'or' || to specify more than one element
Example: --->

let ele = document.getElementById('ab') || document.getElementById('cdb') || null

Above will try to get first element, if it fails, second, and finally will set to
null if both earlier attempts fail

you cannot go for a shortcut 

let ele = document.getElementById('ab').textContent || null
// textContent (ie second action on null element, will error out the script)

----------
Another one from life:
I've decided that I will buy a box for a bike
It needs to have a railing, plate, and a box
My buddy recommended railing, and then spammed me with different boxes
Once everything arrived, it turned out to be all mishmash of different sorts
Plate wouldn't match the box. So I've ordered another plate. Tried to mount 
yesterday with a gnawin feeling that it still wouldn't work because we were 
trying to mix and match different 'systems'. 
Anyway, after an hour or so my mood went to dumps as I realised that it won't work.
But it wasn't really about that at all: it was a realisation that I hava a problem 
on my hands, and it won't resolve easily. I will have to eather buy more shit, or get
outside help from people that have tools and expertese to come up with a custom solution.
This box just generated a number of new problems that I simply didn't want to solve.
Further, I realised that it wasn't my buddies fault, it was mine for not checking. 
I got lazy, didn't do my reasearch, listend to recommendation and pulled a triger.
And here I am. I don't even need the bloody box to begin with, and yet I'm down 250E for 
the pleasure of having some life changing realisations. Nice.
** 20-09-2018 Thursday
Ok so today I've learned that you can brake the loop by using return statement.
Also, if you do that, whatever code below that loop won't execute...wow haha.
Seriously sometimes I wander if I should do this.
I'm starting to worry that while I'm doing all those 'crazy' algorithms and data
structures, I'm not studying design patterns and 'normal' coding. I don't want to 
end up on an interview with a bunch of useless knowledge but no real life skill.

I went for a walk yesterday, took less then an hour to walk around the zoo, its a nice
route. I will get new shoes for running soon, when I'm back from Poland.

I'm going to Poland for a week, leaving on Sunday. I will have to make sure I've prepped 
all documents before I go. 
** 21-09-2018 Friday
It's getting more and more difficult to get out of bed. I'm loosing
my motivation. Day fly by, and I drift away, let the passivity overtake.
This has happened before many times. I had an opportunity to sit down
and code yesterday. I didn't take it. Instead I gave in to that feeling of 
'I'm too tired, I just want to lay down'. Nothing gets done around house.
It's very frustrating, watching myself drift away and waste my life.
<<<<<<< HEAD
** 23-09-2018 Sunday
I've decided that I will fight the illness. Do the gym 6 times a week, walk every day.
Eventually upgrade walking to running if knee will permit. I have to be very careful 
not to injure myself as it would set me back hard. I'm actually scared to do swings
with my kettle given it's weight. On the other hand, what else am I going to do? 
Cower in fear? It worked so far, I see no reason why it shouldn't now. Just gotta be 
careful.
Next week I'll be working from home, which will completely wreck my routine. I'll do my best
to stick to it, but honestly, I'm not very hopefull. It's like this all the time, non stop
interruptions, changes. I don't do well with that. The important part is to keep coding, and to
make sure I get enough excercise every day. 

** 02-10-2018 Tuesday
Every time I go home everything falls apart. Every single habit that I worked to build collapses.
So be it, I'm back and I'm restarting things. Picking up from where I left. Cracking the code:
section on strings / arrays. Learning how to implement efficient string builder. Who knows...
I have a metric ton of things to do outside of coding as well. Things aren't looking good, I've 
been ignoring reality for way too long. And now it's getting bit scary. Little issues has grown.
Plan for today: call Joe, get thingst started with that bike, call the other fella, try to sell the bike.
Maybe put him on some financing. Just get rid of the bike for christ sake. Go for a walk, check out the 
new gym and probably sign up. Start watching vids on how to work out. Order the wrist support.
** 03-10-2018 Wednesday
I'm slowly realising I'm a bitter person. I'm constantly unhappy, brooding, mopping around.
I've been working on my word hygene, and stopped cursing ( too much ). Now I think it's time 
to try and be a nicer person to others around me. I just don't want to be the same old cranky,
bitterish person. In terms of coding, I feel completely overwhelmed. There are so many things, that 
I don't know where to begin. I havent even actually started on the interview questions. Oh well, 
I will go over the implementations first. Gotta learn how to walk before I'll start running. I 
will not pressure myself into skipping basics. 
I've attended yesterday a 'class' on Java, organized by some guys in my company. I'm really 
starting to appreciate my lecturers at college. They weren't perfect, but my god, they are 
miles and leagues beyond and above what I've experienced yesterday. These guys were bloody 
attrocious, god damn. Their english is very unclear, they interrupt each other, keep dropping 
trivia knowledge at begginer level class. Damn guy, you are not professional teachers, and it shows.
But hey, I've learned something, which was rather surprising. Turns out that if you print out 
i++, it will print the  current value before it will increment it. Amazing. No really! :)
** 04-10-2018 Thursday
I've implemented the StringBuilder class. It was kinda fun actually. I've learned about this. ( a little bit)
and about System.arraycopy() which is pretty amazaing come to think of it. 
Also, turn out you can return the evaluation line, and it will implicitly return the boolean result of it.
Great, looks neat, and its more readable then ternary operators. So yesterday was pretty hectic. I've spent whole
afternoon chasing after a bug that was rendering my new FireFox script useless. Finally, million console.logs later,
I found a return line that was inside a loop, and shold have been outside of it ( basically function terminated after 
first loop iteration, which created the whole mess). Can't believe it took me so long to track it down. Anyway,
I got it working ... yay, I've backed up old script...copied over a new one to the server....then it wouldn't work...
so I've made some changes on the fly, then some more...then some more...after an hour I've realized that somehow I've 
overriden the new script with old script ...and basically I've lost 2 weeks work. There. How bout them apples?
** 05-10-2018 Friday
I've got an email from the human resources. The first stage of recruitment process starts on 24th. 
It will be a group stage! Ahhhhh, I can't belive it. It will be one of those generic types of 
recruitment events where you have to talk to bunch of other people in your group. You will look 
at some mickey mouse business case, and they will evaluate your ... what? Communication skills? Are
you capable of talking to other people? Ok, I guess I can do that much yea? Bert told me to keep my
voice down, and not to speak so fast. He said I seem aggressive when talking...damn. Yea, we don't 
want to look aggressive, thats for sure. Anyway, I'm freaking out a bit, but nothing major. I will get
through it, or not...either way, I will move forwar. It's good to finaly have a date. If I drop out after
first stage it will be a bit embarassing, but at least I'll know and I'll be able to start applying outside.
I've bought running shoes yesterday. Went to a shop recommended by a friend, very professional place.
I'm happy with the shoes, I just wander how long it will all last until my knee will stop me from 
excercising. I'm dreading trip to the gym...havent been around for years, my wrist is still very weak and sore, 
so I'm delaying. I might be able to sell my bike finally. Maybe, I don't really trust that fellow. He's alright,
but he has too many variables in his life.
** 08-10-2018 Monday
I've worked a bit on time tracking app on Saturday. Progress is very slow, I'm drowning in Java 8
lambda expressions. It's actually kinda fun, but it will take a while to wrap my head around it.
I've finally went to IKEA and bought cutlery and bowls, and knifes. My god, such trivial things,
and yet so annoying. It was a good walk, 7.5 km each way. Each passing day brings me closer to 
the interview...which reminds me that I have to sing up for it.
** 09-10-2018 Tuesday
The time tracking app will take far more work then I anticipated. There's a ton of logic to be written!
For example, we have to make sure that before we run timer, that there is no record for that day already,
in case timetracker stopped ( for whatever reason ).
If there is, we will have to merge it? I don't even know how to resolve that issue yet. Food for thought.
What else, I decided that the primary key will be just a sequencer and I will insert dates separately.
Search will be done by date and anumber. That should suffice, and it will be better rather than creating
primary key out of DATE+anumber. The former will be easier to search.

** 10-10-2018 Wednesday
Busy busy, I feel like I'm constantly moving. Can't say it's a bad feeling. I'm actually 
making progress with the time tracking app. I'm stuck on how sql writes down Date in it's 
database. I'd rather see actual date format string then a milisecond stamp that tells me 
absolutely nothing. Not sure if it's important tho, am I going to create tool for pulling out
a report, or will I let the use the database tool to view data and not worry about it. 
Probably best if I create reporting tool...sigh, well it's always more practice in Java, and that's
what this whole project is all about. Java, java, java. All day java, wherever I go, Java follows.
I will keep writing, reading, and listening Java until I actually like it. Before that happens, 
I have to REALLY understand how it works and how to use it effectively. Gotta get good at something
before you'll like it. Right? Also, two weeks left till the interview process begins.
** 12-10-2018 Friday
We missed yesterday because I foolishly forgot my keys...actually no! I've decided 
that I will go for a run. I knew that was a bad idea, but I went with it anyway. I left 
for town, the moment I closed the door behind me, I realised that I didn't take my keys 
with me. I decided that someone will be home for sure, when I'll get back. Well I was 
wrong. It took 5 hours before one of my housemates finally arrived. It costed me time, and 
15 euro in bullshit beer purchases at the local pub. Was it worth it? Well, that was a 
valuable lesson for sure. Don't break your own rules! Time and time again, just don't.
Today I've learned that you cannot declare generic array, because it needs to know the 
type at the declaration stage. So if you wanted  to implement your own array list, using 
generic types, well you are not in luck. But you can just use 'Object' type, and you are 
sorted. Except you can't use primitive types now...but oh well. Also, turns out there is
a language called Groovy, which is like a groovy Java. Cool. Won't be learning it!

** 13-10-2018 Saturday
We did it, we implemented HashMap, StringBuilder & ArrayList. Damn, that was NOT exciting.
But at the same time, it was very educational, especially from perspective of StringBuilder.
So now we finally can start to do actual interview questions. Wow..what was it? A month, two?
I'm on page 100, and I'm starting actual questions only now, damn. Also, interview is approaching
very quickly. I'm avoiding design patterns, not sure why. The book that I have is REALLY good,
yet there is fear inside of me whenever a thought of studying it emerges. It's always the same:
"I'm so tired, I deserve some rest, I can't work all the time...". I do have the time, I could
squize it, and regularly watch youtube vids about it. I just choose not to. Lets see if we can
do something about it.

** 15-10-2018 Monday
I took a day off yesterday, as planned! Today I've learned about bit operators?
So, for example << means we shift the bit value of given int to the left. So, int 8 
is 1 0 0 0, so, 8 << by 1 equals 1 0 0 0 0 ... 16. Yes?
Next, we have bit OR and AND  |=   &=
Lets say we have two ints 13 and 18
0 1 1 0 1
1 0 0 1 0
-------------
1 1 1 1 1   13 |= 18 will give us 31??

------------
0 0 0 0 0   13 &= 18 will give us 0

Lets say I'm not exactly confident about the above, but it's a start!

** 16-10-2018 Tuesday
Moving along, almost done with second question. Going today to Limerick to visit a friend.
I'm feeling good. Also, going to sell the realforce keyboard ( if all goes well ).

** 18-10-2018 Thursday
I went to Limerick yesterday. Sold off the keyboard, and visited my friend. She's doing
great. They bought a house, which is very nice, have a new car, which is also nice. They 
keep busy. I'm not very inspired when it comes to building that time tracking app. I got 
stuck on the time transfer issue ( from database to java ). Turns out there are some timezone
issues? Maybe? I have no idea why it's not recording correct time...or retreiving one...not sure!
Anyhoo, it's taking forever. As always, so there. I'll be attending graduation party for the NCI.
What the hell, why not. My blender arrived, its savage, absolute beast. Also, I thought for a sec
that my bike is going to burst in flames on my way to Limerick. I was not happy, fortunately it
was just some gunk from the sprocket near the engine that fell off and burned up a bit on the
exhaust pipe. 
OW YEA....I QUIT SMOKING! FOR GOOD.
** 19-10-2018 Friday
Working on palindromes. Wow, it is taking forever. Good excerecise though!
Yesterday was my first day without cigarette in a long time. Happy days.
** 20-10-2018 Saturday
I went out yesterday for a company  outing. Free beer & food. What not to like right? 
I hate social events, so awkward. Anyway, I had half a pint and felt sick. Left on the spot.
The palidrome problem is getting really annoying. There's a bug, and rightly so. I've built the
whole things without once tracking the progress and testing the outputs. Anyway, something is 
seriously wrong. Also, its too long, I'm duplicating code. It's very cumbersome. I haven't 
seen the solution yet, but I can imagine she will do it in like 5 fucken lines, where I'm on line 100 or 
something like that. Ehhh. Anyway, Saturday, I'll be coming in to work to chip away at the 
time tracker app. I've made some good progress yesterday despite REALLY not wanting to work on it.
So what's left: get the timer displayed. Maybe move a bunch of methods from 'button' class to 'sql queries'
class or something like that. I struggle with the whole OOP concept. But hey, at least we know how to use
singletones now. Cool. So really, reporting part is left to do. The boring part? Well, all I have to do 
is a new display for admin, with few buttons: date selection, name selection and Find button. Spit out the
query results and be done with it. Find a way to export to excel and we are good to go.
** [2018-10-21 Sun]
Day off! No cracking the code today. No smoothies. No going to work. Just chill.
Also, I'd like to write down things that I've learned every day, instead of recording
pointless mudane things that happen in my life.
***  Vector is a growable list. It's different from ArrayList by being THREAD SAFE ie. it's
synchronized unlike AL. 
*** Java has a built in Observable class ( not an interface ), so you have to extend it.
*** Remember to pass in Subject reference ( obj ) to the Observer constructor so that it 
can register itself 
*** Emacs: Alt+ Enter will enter new heading similar to the previous one
*** C-c S-1 will open the callendar! Wish I knew that one before ! It can insert date stamps
which look way better than my 'insert date' function signature
*** M-S-left/right arrow : change the indentation of the bullet points
*** Observable class has a setChanged() method
its a boolean, if its not set to true, Subject will not send notification to the Observers
*** Observer Pattern:
-describes a ONE TO MANY relationship
-Subject updates Observers using common interface
-Observers are loosely coupled ( Subject doen't know much about them )
-Java implementation requeries Subject to be a sub class of Observable ( has limitations )
-Listeners rely on this pattern
-It handles two things that vary: state and number of observers that depend on that state
*** Program to interfaces not implementations!:
Example: ArrayList list = new ArrayList();  // Bad !
         List list = new ArrayList()        // good ! 
If we ever want to change list to LinkedList it will be easier to do, because previously 
used methods didn't rely on any ArrayList specific methods.
*** OO Principles: 
1)Encapsulate what varies
2)Program to interface not implementation
3)Strive for loose couplings between objects that interact
4)Composition over inheritance
*** OO Basics:
1) Abstraction
2) Encapsulation
3) Polymorphism
4) Inheritance
*** Composition:
Describes HAS-A relationship
*** Inheritance
Describes IS-A relationship

   Interview is approaching! Wednesday 9.30am
*** Iterating over array that counted occurrances:
    If you do that, remember that you want to take VALUE of array to test the count,
    but you want to take INDEX to determine what char it is ( because you use it for ASCII chars )
*** Read the QUESTION CAREFULLY!
    I didn't and ended up building a monterous algorithm that actually built the foken all possible
    permutations of a string. Sick! While doing so I've made a bunch of mistakes which ended up
    teaching me a valuable lessons. Yay. But we did make an algo that wasn't requested. Nay!
    So, all in all...valuable experience. God damn palidrome...I thought the algo was infi loop, but
    in fact it was taking so long...! I had an array of 127 eles that I was trying to permute.

*** Bitwise operators
<< shift bit to the left
&  this is AND operation on bits
|  this is OR operation on bits 
bit &= x      bit = bit & x
bit |= x      bit = bit | x

*** Always do the examples first before putting down any code!
*** If you are checking index ahead in a loop, alway check for OUT OF BOUNDS!
*** You can check which string is shorter by using ternary comparisons ( you need 2 )
I had the interview day yesterday. Turned out it wasn't going to be just group tasks.
There was 1 hour intro about Fidelity. Then we had a technical test on laptops, where 
we were allowed to use google. Afterwards, we had a group task, where we discussed some
benefit plan. I completely missed the whole point of the task, so I ended up floundering 
about like a fool. Anyway, final task was a one on one interview. Wow. Did not see that 
coming. Seriously, haven't prepared at all! And while I was there, I struggled with the
simpliest questions. There was even 'white' board test, where I was asked to print 12x12
square with  numbers multiplied. It took me ages to figure out that all it was a two loop
task. Embarasing to say the least. I was so nervous I couln't see it. Seriously bad. 
How can I possibly solve complex and challenging tasks if my mind goes 'tabula rasa' on 
two loop question? Damn, I guess I need more practice. Both in terms of problem solving,
as well as interview practice. That's it, gotta start doing more interviews!

I've spent all day yesterday explaining to others why I won't get the job
while simultaneously hoping for it and waiting for a call / email. 
It's bit nerve wrecking.

*** If you adjust one end of loop, ensure you check the other as well:
    I didn't check the 'edges', my loops started from 1 instead of 0, so I should have adjusted the other 'end'
    as well: i<=n
*** When printing out ensure you get the whitspace right:
    I didn't check for the whitespace between printed elements at all
*** When printing out, check for the last element condition:
    You don't want to print out whitespace after the last element gets printed ( most likely ),
    so make sure you put in the if condition to fook forward ( i+1 <= n )
*** When asked at interview 'how do you keep up with tech changes'
    DOCUMENTATION!

*** BitSize constructor creates it with default size of 64, use size() method to check it
*** Use length() method to access inserted elements ( it will give 0 if nothing inserted )
    Despite it's size being initialized at 64.
    Size doubles if we exceed it

I took two days off ( bank holiday weekend ). I've met with a friend
who works at Microsoft. I have to admit their office is AMAZING, but hey,
it's still Microsoft. I loved his desk setup, huge monitors, fast computer
(no vm nonsense ). Awesome. I've spent last Saturday messing with bloody 
emacs instead of doing work... oh well, I guess it makes sense to set it up
finally, so that I don't have to keep shuffling bloody text editors.
So what did I learn today:
** [2018-10-31 Wed]
I've the offer! Great!! So...what now? I guess that depends on what we consider
most benefitial to our current situation. Do we continue waking up at 4am and 
studying? If so, what do we study? What about our personal life? That could use
some work for sure? Plenty to consider. 
Here's what I'll do: continue as I did before. Keep the routine, continue prepping
for interview. The one I'll have in one year time. Money at the moment isn't very
good, so I have to think about moving to a better position right from the get go.

I'm still struggling with the square problem. It's a good problem. I think I figured
idea how to solve it, now I need to implement. Fun times.
** [2018-11-01 Thu]
It's been nagging me since Tuesday, the thought that I haven't negociated 
for my salary. Since I haven't signed anything yet, I've decided to send 
an email arguing for 10% increase in base salary. Yes I realise it's not idea,
yes I've accepted offer verbally already. I know, I know! Still, I gotta do this,
even if nothing comes out of it. I have to start practicing negotiations, from today,
not sometime in the future. The future is here old man!

I've signed up with the gym. Only two months will cost me 100 euro, but I think I've 
delayed long enough. It's time to start doing something about my situation.
** [2018-11-02 Fri]
Yesterday was a really good day. The news that I got the job were spread.
Everyone congratulated me. I was ... still am.. pretty taken aback how
people were happy for me. Quite amazing.
I'm still struggling with the qube rotatation problem, but I'm making progress.
Instead of shifting one element at the time, lets just copy whole rows. Let's not
worry about traversing deep into the square.
** [2018-11-03 Sat]
I went to the gym yesterday. Good workout, in and out in less then 30 min. 
I realized I have no idea how to do excercises anymore. It's been over 5 years?
Anyway, I'm really happy, first time is always the hardest. I will rotate run day
with a gym day. There is plenty of reasearch that needs to be done. 
I'm still struggling with the square rotation. I got the outer layer rotation done,
but somehow the recursive sections are crapping out. It makes my head go 'auch' just
looking at those loops. We are talking small squares, 4 in length, and I'm already 
perspirating. Good times.
I'm going to work on the time tracker app today. Want to get it out of the way asap.
There's too much other work that needs to be done, and it's annoying me that I still
have this one going on.
Finally, Emerson collected the bike yesterday. He smoothly changed the deal, he won't 
take it from me officially, but instead will clean it up & flip it.

Dzien wolny od pracy. Nic nie robie. Po trudach, jak zwykle, udalo mi sie zainstalowac nowy config do emacs. 
Wow to niesamowite jak wszystko jest trudne z tym edytorem. No ale jak juz dziala to dziala. Ehhh, nie wiem
na co mi te wszystkie godziny spedzone nad tym edytorem. Idea jest dobra, ale ...wow. 
I did it! I managed to reverse the square. Something that seemed way over my head.
Come to think of it now, it seems trivial. Right? Just loop over, copy and paste. No big deal...
Seriously, it took me ... 4 days? I'm happy that I had an issue at the very end, as it forced me
to use debugger. It's really nice! It helped me spot the issue right away, great stuff! Just 
following the variables is such a help. In this case I didn't set a separate counter for temporary
array, which was fine on first iteration ( starting from index 0), but on each subsequent call
starting index incremented which messed up everything. I'm very happy, this is why I do what 
I do!
And of course the book solution makes it look trivial, and even after analysing it, I still don't get it. Typical. Not to mention she did it in like 30 lines, where mine is like an Old Testament. Typical.
** [2018-11-06 Tue]
Big day! I really didn't want to study today, I ended up creating ads for my slr camera and tripod.
But once I've started analyzing the solution by Gail of the square rotation...i realized it's the same
thing as with the towers of hanoi! All you have to do is to look at the example, specific example:
[0,3] goes to [0,0] y is fixed for fist, x is fixed for the latter. From there you can figure out what 
goes where, especially if you consider next iteration...where will the marker / index be? Wow, 
woooow. It actually worked, I was able to retrace her solution. No genius involved, just step by
step analysis. That's it. Amazing!
** [2018-11-07 Wed]
I waste too much time. For instance, when at work I spend way too much time chatting and joking around. 
Also, I use my friend as an excuse to spend time away from work, by 'helping' him with coding. I don't think
it's doing much good to both of us. He needs to suffer and learn on his own in order to develop enough spine.
I'd like to  finish up the time tracker project already so I can focus on cleaning up my code base for future generations.
That will take ages but I think it will be fun, organizing everything. 
*** When making a nested array, don't forget the commas between elements!
*** When iterating over nested array, remember that second layer takes first
layer as parameter 
for ( i=0, i<arr.len,i++){
    for(j=0, j<arr[i].len,j++)
}
ARR[I].len !!!!

I've given a short presentation on our work & how we go about it to a big boss from 
God knows where. Point is, he was surrounded by bosses of my bosses, so stakes were
high ( at least for them ). So, since I was talking about work, it was a perfect opportunity
to brag about Sprint app, and how amazing it is. So I did, and I think things went smooth.
The guy was friendly, cracked jokes without being condencending, so yea, seemed legit.
I wonder how do you get so far in career? He is seriously high level, still in early fifties?
He did amazingly well career wise. I'd really like to ask him how he got where he is, like 
no bullshit style. Plain, painful truth. Work 80hr/ week? 
*** when iterating over nested array / matrix you dont 
have to use [i][j]...instead you can just use [0][j] because 0 row will have the same length
as [i-th] row and rows inbetween. Genius.

Yesterday all hell broke loose right from the start, when Sprint started breaking down because
browser wouldn't serve 'mixed content' ie. my scripts which I've been happily injecting without
understanding how the whole thing actually works. So there I was, trying to set up https server
so the browser would stop complaining. I didn't get far, but I made some progress. I managed to 
get openssl software 'installed' on my computer, so that I can generate the keys. Now, my hopes 
are that self signed keys will do to stop the browser from complaining. I mean, even if the connection
isn't certified, it's still https ... so it shouldn't block the mixed content...right??? 
I've spent all morning setting things up instead of doing 'crack the code'. I'd rather do the real life
problems than the book abstract crap.
