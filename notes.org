** 10-08-2018 Friday
First day of freedom. I've finished my fourth degree, which is a complete overkill, but hey, what can you do? 
So what now? Prep for interview! Already got a fancy book, with hundreds of exercises to do. We'll see how this 
fares. Not sure if I want to do the exercises in Java or stick to JS. Probably latter, given that I really want 
to focus on just one programming language. I'm also changing the morning routine. I'll be waking up at 4am now,
as opposed to 5.30, because I found that I'm just not gettin anything done in the afternoon after work. So yea,
I'll give it a go and see what happens. 

** 11-08-2018 Saturday
I slept in. Had yesterday meeting with a software dev team manager. Looks like his going to try and help me out.
He wasn't very reassuring though, saying that for someone to get into tech would be tough, its easier to move out
of it. Anywawy, he might get me a mock interview which would be great. So now I'm under pressure to prepare for it.
Unfortunately, my company is all about Java, so I'll have to brush up on it, and store away JS for the time being.
Whats the plan for today: study for 2 hours, and then relax I guess. 
** 15-08-2018 Wednesday
I'm having problem saving changes made in org file ( this bloody file ! ). No idea what is causing it. Honesty, its
pain enough to keep this blog running after whole day. I really don't feel like tinkering away at some useless stuff
like this. 
Ok I figure it out...this file is OUTSIDE of my git folder...what the actual..

** 17-08-2018 Friday
I didn't study yesterday after work. Felt very tired and bit dejected. Today I've made some good progress on the 
Big O notations. Its going slow but steady I guess. I've spent last two days at work working on my Sprint app. 
I made it look nicer! I really enjoyed tinkering with it, but enough is enough, I recogize it's a waste of time.

Worket through fibonacci and cached version that uses memoization ( never heard of it before ).
Normal fibonacci is O(2toN) where cached version is O(N) which is pretty amazing!
All we do in cached version is retrieval of previous values and summation ! Since fibonacci is a 
sume of two previous numbers -- and we start with 0 & 1...we don't really do anything other then
saving previous result and adding stored results to each other on next call.
Memoization remembers all the previous results - hence we don't have to do the same calculations
over and over again ( makes sense ! ).
I have to fix my CV today and send it over for review. 
** 21-08-2018
I've worked through the rest of examples of Big O notation. Working on further examples now. 
I'm making progress on sqlite tutorial at work. Still not sure how to design the time taking 
algorithm. Originally I was thinking just to start timer, and stop it when button is pressed. 
Whatever time was calculated save to the database. But what if the computer crashes or whatever?
So instead, maybe keep saving progress of time by 30 min increments? This way, if anything 
happens, at least we have some data. 
Once timer starts, save progress every 30 min. We don't take note of brakes so that 
makes life easier.

Very bad day yesterday, mood is down, things to do pile up. Gotta keep marching on, and remember that
not everything ( acutally very few things ) are really important. 
The bad: My illness flared up again, I will
not have luggage for the spanish trip, I'm behind with the CV, my private life is in shambles, I'm 
constantly tired because I wake up at 4am to do this thing.
The good: I don't have a permanent illness, it will pass. At least I can afford to go to Spain in the
first place, and I have friends to go with ! I have someone looking after me, trying to help me get a 
job, and motivating me to make a CV. I have a reason to get up at 4am!! 
Good times.

Sometimes I'm afraid of the coming morning, the fact that I will have to tackle problems
that make my brain hurt. It's uncomfortable, and I'd like to very much avoid it. I've read
this book called 'Too good to be ignored' or something like that, where the author spells it
out: 'True growth lies outside of comfort zone'. But he puts it in different way, talks about
physical pain and discomfort. He gave a really good comparison of himself and some other guy.
They both played guitar when teenarges, but the latter achieved massive success because he 
kept training on the edge of his abilities constantly! The former spent far less time outside 
the comfort zone. 
That's what I can see in myself, I very rarely venture out to the 'unknown'. Both in life, and
in my learning. I'm old enough to know that there's no point in making myself empty promises. 
The only thing that really works ( for me ), are painfully slow incremental improvements.
** 26-08-2018
I've missed few days, things are falling apart. My current illness is not helping.
I havent coded at all, I did follow few tutorials online, and looked more into the 
time tracker application. I decided to go with the JavaFX for the UI, given that
there is plenty of tutorials on it, and it looks very promising. I will stick
with SQLite, given how remarkably small it is, and the fact that it's serverless.
I don't know if I will work on reporting side of the whole project, but I guess
it would make sense. 
I feel like I'm trying to do too many things at once: work on Cracking the Code, 
read through the Design Patterns, build a timetracker app, wake up at 4am, solve 
catas...its too much. I know my strenghts, and multitasking is not one of them.
I will axe Design Patterns and catas for the time being. I'd like to keep doing 
the interview prep every day for 2hrs and dedicate rest of my time to the time 
tracker. I believe that building  an app will give me more practice in coding
than solving random catas online. 
** 27-08-2018
I realised that I have no idea what hash tables/maps are. Turns out
they are a big deal. Great, what a relief, I can dive into tutorial
rather than break my brain on those crazy algos. There's a whole list 
of data structures that I absolutely have to know. I'll start with 
the one I don't know anything about, and refresh the later on.
** 12-09-2018
It's been a while since my last entry. Not going to bs, things are tough.
I got sick and I used it as an excuse to let my routine collapse. Then came
annual leave, and here we are, half a month later. I'm not going to overthink 
it or beat myself about it. Just gotta pick up where I left and keep on moving.
** 13-09-2018
I'm absolutely terrified of each morning, scared that I won't understand
the questions. Makes no sense right? I mean, the asumption is that I don't 
get things, THAT'S why I'm learning them. Interesting. Anyway, it's going
really slow. I'm trying to wrap my  head around some very basic concepts.
I'm learning about hash tables at the moment, trying to figure out how to
get duplicates out of it etc. 
I've learned yesterday that I might have a shot at the interview for the
internal graduate scheme. That would set me on a fast track to becoming a 
programmer. This is it, I guess. Best chance I'll get in a while. Of course
I'm terrified that I will blow it, as I usually do. It weird that even good 
things scare me. 
** 14-09-2018
I've sent my first CV, going for the Leap program.
Bit stressed out about it, this could be a game changer. 
Still stuck on hash tables, turnes out they don't allow duplicate keys
(they do, in so much they don't throw error -> they simply overwrite old value).
So now I'm exploring the Lists, and further, I think it's unnecesary to use it 
for the problem that I'm looking...oh wait maybe it is ...
** 15-09-2018
Difference between List and Set: the latter follows mathematical notion of set,
meaning, no duplicates allowed. Set also uses hash values to allocate elements,
and that's why it doesn't preserve the insertion order ( unlike List )
I finally finished the very first example from the book. Yay! Theres like 100 more
to go. At this rate I will finish next year...Nay! Haha.
Today I plan to go to work, on the timetracker application, and then go to the 'Coder
dojo' for kids...no idea why tho. All I knew ( when I was asked ) was that I didn't 
want to do it...so I decided to do it, just on that basis. So we are going. That's that.
** 16-09-2018
Sunday - day off. Played new indie game, bit grindy, but still fun. Altough, I'm trying to hard,
I should just finish it without min maxing.

Permutations: order of the selection matters !

Permutations:
If we have 4 candies, and we can only select 2, how many permutations?
First question: how many stages / selections / choices ?
Anser: Two: first and second
First choice: how many options? Answer = 4 
Second choice: how many options?       = 3
Total permutations? 4 * 3 = 12

Formula = n! / (n-r)!  
r-number of ways things can be selected (in above case, 2)

Permutations without restrictions:
4 candies, how many max permutations?
4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1
------------------------------
Combination: order of selection doesn't matter !
Example: red red blue == red blue red ( same combination of colors, just different order )

Formula = n! / (n-r)!r!

For example: 4 colors, 2 choices =>
4*3*2*1 / (4-2)!*( 2*1 )
24 / 2*2
24 / 4
Answer == 6 combinations

We worked only 1 hour today. I did spend time on excercises.
** 18-09-2018
I 'solved' the permutation example. It turned out to be trivial, once 
you realise something quite obvious. I don't think I'd be able to figure 
it out in the stressful situation such as an interview, but oh well, no
point worrying about it. We keep on marching forward. Time is running out.
** 19-09-2018
Had a horrible day yesterday, but there was plenty to be learned from it:

JavaScript:
turns out, when you try to perform an operation on an element
that doesn't exists, you will get an error that stops execution of the rest 
of the script. 
For example: -->
let element = document.getElementById('abc').innerHTML
Above has two actions: gets the element, and then gets the inner html content
If the first fails, thats fine, but then the second action will result in fatal
error
Solution: -->
let element = document.getElementById('abc')  // get your element
if ( element ) let content = element.innerHTML  // test if element exists, and get content

Yes its more verbose but it works really well, which is fine with me
----------

Another one:
You can use 'or' || to specify more than one element
Example: --->

let ele = document.getElementById('ab') || document.getElementById('cdb') || null

Above will try to get first element, if it fails, second, and finally will set to
null if both earlier attempts fail

you cannot go for a shortcut 

let ele = document.getElementById('ab').textContent || null
// textContent (ie second action on null element, will error out the script)

----------
Another one from life:
I've decided that I will buy a box for a bike
It needs to have a railing, plate, and a box
My buddy recommended railing, and then spammed me with different boxes
Once everything arrived, it turned out to be all mishmash of different sorts
Plate wouldn't match the box. So I've ordered another plate. Tried to mount 
yesterday with a gnawin feeling that it still wouldn't work because we were 
trying to mix and match different 'systems'. 
Anyway, after an hour or so my mood went to dumps as I realised that it won't work.
But it wasn't really about that at all: it was a realisation that I hava a problem 
on my hands, and it won't resolve easily. I will have to eather buy more shit, or get
outside help from people that have tools and expertese to come up with a custom solution.
This box just generated a number of new problems that I simply didn't want to solve.
Further, I realised that it wasn't my buddies fault, it was mine for not checking. 
I got lazy, didn't do my reasearch, listend to recommendation and pulled a triger.
And here I am. I don't even need the bloody box to begin with, and yet I'm down 250E for 
the pleasure of having some life changing realisations. Nice.
** 20-09-2018 Thursday
Ok so today I've learned that you can brake the loop by using return statement.
Also, if you do that, whatever code below that loop won't execute...wow haha.
Seriously sometimes I wander if I should do this.
I'm starting to worry that while I'm doing all those 'crazy' algorithms and data
structures, I'm not studying design patterns and 'normal' coding. I don't want to 
end up on an interview with a bunch of useless knowledge but no real life skill.

I went for a walk yesterday, took less then an hour to walk around the zoo, its a nice
route. I will get new shoes for running soon, when I'm back from Poland.

I'm going to Poland for a week, leaving on Sunday. I will have to make sure I've prepped 
all documents before I go. 
** 21-09-2018 Friday
It's getting more and more difficult to get out of bed. I'm loosing
my motivation. Day fly by, and I drift away, let the passivity overtake.
This has happened before many times. I had an opportunity to sit down
and code yesterday. I didn't take it. Instead I gave in to that feeling of 
'I'm too tired, I just want to lay down'. Nothing gets done around house.
It's very frustrating, watching myself drift away and waste my life.
